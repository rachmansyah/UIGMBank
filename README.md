FINAL PROJECT

Make a simple program using java. Your program must include the following:
•	At least 4 classes, not including the test class
•	Encapsulate these, and additional classes
•	Provide at least 2 fields and 2 methods in every class, not including getters or setters
•	An Array or ArrayList
•	The ability to accept user-input at least once. 
•	Always accept user input without crashing.
•	Add at least 2 new concept in java programming (interface, sorting, collection, generic, regex,recursion,jdbc, etc.) 

You’re welcome to base your program on any of the following examples or create your own scenario:
Create game
Model an employee database.  Supply a collection of employees.  Provide methods to order or display employees by their salary and productivity ratings.  Allow the manager to fire all employees who earn above-average salaries but offer below-average productivity.  Allow the manager to hire new employees.
Develop a meal-planner which assembles a list of food a person can eat in one day based on user-specified calorie limit and an even larger list of every possible food included in the program.
Create a text choose-your-own-adventure game
Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game (Noughts and Crosses)
You may use previous problem sets, exercises, or lecture notes as inspiration to help you get started, but your program must be significantly different from these material
